# Radio Jammer
This is my very first electronics "real" project !
I made this device in 2011 ! (I'm old now...)
This is a 104.40 MHz FM radio jammer.
It is a simple quartz oscillator which send half exponential waves at a 104.40 MHz frequency.
This is has low power and can only jam radios arround 5-10m maximum.

# Disclaimer !
This is illegal to jam radio services etc... This was made for educational purpouse only !

# Schematics
The schematics are based on an old electronics book. In 2018 i retro-engineered what I made 7 years ago.

# Routing
The PCB was made thanks to tape, a copper board and iron perchlorate. /!\ Be careful, it's dangerous !
I can't provide any details about it, I didn't take notes back then :/
